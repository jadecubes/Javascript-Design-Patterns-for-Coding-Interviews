# Introduction
## What are behavioral patterns?
In this chapter, we will discuss behavioral patterns. These patterns ensure effective communication between different objects in a system, assign responsibilities to them, and make sure they all have synchronized information.

These behavioral patterns include:

- Chain of responsibility

- Interpreter

- Command

- Iterator

- Mediator

- Memento

- State

- Template Method

- Strategy

- Visitor

- Observer

- Revealing Module


We wonâ€™t be able to cover all the patterns mentioned above in this chapter. From the list above, we will be covering the following: chain of responsibility pattern, command pattern, iterator pattern, mediator pattern, observer pattern, and visitor pattern.
