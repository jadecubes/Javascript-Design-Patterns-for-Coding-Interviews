# Types of Design Patterns
In the previous lesson, you learned what design patterns are. Now, we’ll look at some popular design patterns in JavaScript. These include the following:

## Creational design patterns
These patterns are used to provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situation without revealing the creation method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the creation process.

Below is a chart that shows the patterns that fall under this category:

## Structural design patterns
These patterns concern class/object composition and relationships between objects. They let you add new functionalities to objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not affect the rest. Hence, when some parts of structure change, the entire system does not need to change.

## Behavioral design patterns
These patterns are concerned with communication between dissimilar objects in a system. They streamline the communication and make sure the information is synchronized between such objects.

## Architectural design patterns
These patterns are used for solving architectural problems within a given context in software architecture.

As discussed, design patterns play a major role in the structuring of an application and is of great use to a JavaScript developer. This course is designed to help you practice some of these patterns so you can confidently answer any questions related to them in an interview and be able to implement them at your job.
