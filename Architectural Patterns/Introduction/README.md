# Introduction
## What are architectural patterns?
In this chapter, we will discuss architectural design patterns. As the name implies, these patterns help build an efficient architecture for the application. They provide a set of subsystems with assigned responsibilities that include guidelines on constructing relationships between these subsystems.

We will cover three main architectural patterns in this chapter:

- MVC pattern

- MVP pattern

- MVVM pattern
